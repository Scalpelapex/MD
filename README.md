# Work2 -  Modular reconfigurable robot

## - DESIGN DESCRIPTION - 

This project designs a modular reconfigurable multi-configuration biomimetic robot that can be reconfigured for different tasks through docking mechanisms, becoming a hexapod robot, quadruped robot, or snake robot to enhance environmental adaptability. Different modules can move independently and work together to complete tasks.

# Work3 -  Miniature Torque Test Bench

## - DESIGN DESCRIPTION - 

This platform was originally designed to build a simple miniature torque measurement platform (less than 0.1N) for scientific use only. The platform can be adjusted in three degrees of freedom directions: two translations and one rotation, by means of a fine-tuning knob.

# Work4 -  Constant force test rigs

## - DESIGN DESCRIPTION - 

The purpose of this design is to obtain a simple constant force measurement platform. Commercially available force measuring platforms are basically characterised by Hooker's law, as the internal construction of force gauges mostly uses springs. Our design is based on gravity to get a constant thrust detection structure.

# Work5 - Tracking disinfection cart

## - DESIGN DESCRIPTION - 

This design is the first time I participated in a science and technology innovation competition during my sophomore year in college. At that time, the design was still very immature, but it had great commemorative significance.

The purpose of this design is to create a visually controlled patrol and disinfection car based on the McNam wheel. The car will work continuously along the wiring trajectory and will stop for disinfection when it encounters a target that needs to be disinfected.

# Work5 -  Carbon free car

## - DESIGN DESCRIPTION - 

This project is designed for extracurricular competitions. The design requirement is to use the gravitational potential energy of a 1kg weight to drive the car to move along a specified trajectory. Our transmission design is based on gears and camshafts. Gear transmission is used for reduction ratio design, while cam design is used to adjust direction.
